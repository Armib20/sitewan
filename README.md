# Rubik's Cube

A Rubik's Cube model built with in-browser rendering 3D graphics library Three.js. Extension of a computer graphics course assignment.

## How to interact with the cube:
- click on individual cubes to change material
- use key bindings "R", "L", "M", "U", "D", "F", "B" which correspond to the [Rubik's Cube notation](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/)
- note: front face is always taken to be +z face


## Currently in the works:
- face rotation animation
- cube solver
- face rotation key bindings relative to orientation wrt camera
